# Webstack-Ecommerce
This is website of Ecommerce and mostly based upon on sports wear . Basically i have created it by basic CSS and HTML. I prepared this as an induction task given by our web development club "webwiz" society of NIT Rourkela. Sourav Kumar Sahoo(125BT0029) used good color combinations, buttons, drop-down list, login and registration bar and products descriptions in my project. I learnt HTML and CSS from YouTube and has done many designing practice in Figma and Canva. I gave my best in this website development task. Moreover, I took help from MDN REFERENCE present in Visual studio Code for understanding uses of different tools of HTML and CSS.I am also using Git-Hub for the very first time.
